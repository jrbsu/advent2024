## Advent of Code 2024

This repo stores my efforts during the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Each day has its own folder. For most days, this will include:
- My attempt (usually "script.py")
- My input data (usually "input.txt")
- ChatGPT's efforts at improving my code (usually "gpt_solution.py") â€” this is pretty much just to have something to learn from
